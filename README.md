# Classroom Code Examples

## Overview
- This repository contains various Python code examples and functions discussed and used during our classroom sessions. 
- These examples are designed to help students understand fundamental programming concepts, improve their coding skills, and apply what they have learned in class.

## Contents
The repository includes functions and code snippets covering topics such as:
- Variables concepts
- Operation on variables (Boolean, Arithmetic, Relational)
- Control the flow of a program via `if-else`
- Basic loop structures (`for` loops, `while` loops)
- List operations and iterations
- File handling (reading and writing to files)
- Basic input validation
- String manipulation
- Counting elements in a list based on conditions
- Basic dictionary concepts
- Simple algorithms and logic building
- etc...

## Purpose
- These code examples are provided as supplementary learning materials to assist students in practicing and mastering the concepts taught in class. 
- They could be used as a reference for writing code and completing assignments.

## Usage
- Review each code snippet to understand the logic and structure.
- Use these examples to guide your practice and to help you solve similar problems.
- Do not copy the code verbatim for assignments unless instructed. Always try to understand and modify the code to fit your specific requirements.

## Important Notes
- These examples are for educational purposes only.
- Make sure to follow the coding standards and guidelines discussed in class.
- Practice writing code on your own to reinforce learning.

## Contributions
These code snippets have been prepared by the instructor for use during CS151 classroom sessions. Students are encouraged to ask questions and seek clarifications if any part of the code is not clear.

## Disclaimer
- This repository is not meant to be a comprehensive guide to Python programming. 
- It is intended to supplement the course material and provide practical examples discussed during class.
